# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. The goal is to model the sequential dependencies in stock price trends and provide actionable insights through accurate predictions and visualizations.

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes historical stock price data for LSTM compatibility.
- **LSTM Model Implementation**: Builds a deep learning model to predict future stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Compares actual and predicted stock prices to assess performance.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Historical stock price data (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Kaggle).
- **Columns Used**:
  - `Date`
  - `Open`
  - `High`
  - `Low`
  - `Close`
  - `Volume`

Ensure your dataset is saved in `data/stocks.csv`.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



---


## Results
- Predicted stock prices align closely with actual prices, showcasing the model's accuracy.
- Sample visualization:

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional features like technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Add support for real-time predictions using APIs.
- Implement ensemble models for improved accuracy.
